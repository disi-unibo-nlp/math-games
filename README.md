# MathGames: A Benchmark from the International Mathematical Games Competition  

This repository contains the code and data for our paper:  
**_Can Large Language Models Win the International Mathematical Games?_**  

MathGames is a benchmark featuring **2,183 high-quality, playful-style mathematical problems** in an open-ended format (i.e., without multiple-choice answers). The dataset includes:  
- **1,389 textual problems**  
- **794 multimodal problems** (requiring both text and images)  

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Access  

The dataset is available as a **Hugging Face dataset**. However, to maintain anonymity, we currently provide it only as a JSONL file:  
ðŸ“„ **[`data/math_games.jsonl`](data/math_games.jsonl)**  

To reconstruct the **multimodal exercises**, please download the corresponding images from our **[Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Dq32HB9E5HWTdL5HWC66CAmotwFnUpDk?usp=sharing)**.
